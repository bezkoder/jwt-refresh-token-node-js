While speaking English, you will probably feel that you’re making a hundred mistakes – but, in fact, you’re only making the same five or six mistakes’ hundreds of times. Get over your shyness and hesitation. Use the language as often as you can, the more you speak the faster you will learn and easier it becomes."
